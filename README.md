# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

This project notebook (`Project_cleaned.ipynb`) focuses on applying a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time series forecasting. It demonstrates how deep learning can be used to predict sequential data trends using Python and PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## üìä Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, sequence generation, and reshaping for RNN input.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of LSTM layers, training routines, and prediction loops.
- **Evaluation**: Loss curve visualization, prediction vs actual plots, and model performance analysis.
- **Applications**: Can be adapted to forecasting tasks like energy consumption, stock prices, or crime data.
