Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
This project notebook (Project_cleaned.ipynb) focuses on using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time series forecasting. It demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to predict sequential data trends using Python and either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Involves normalization, generating input sequences, and reshaping data to be compatible with RNN models.

Model Building: Constructs an LSTM model, defines the training process, and generates predictions.

Evaluation: Includes visualizations such as training loss curves and comparisons between actual and predicted values to assess performance.

Applications: This approach can be adapted to various forecasting tasks, including predicting energy consumption, stock prices, or crime trends.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on implementation)

scikit-learn (for data scaling and preprocessing)

Getting Started
1. Install Required Libraries
Use the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch
If you're using TensorFlow instead of PyTorch, replace torch with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow
2. Run the Notebook
Open the notebook with Jupyter:

bash
